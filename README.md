# Pasture

Put your passwords out to Pasture.


### Pasture?

Pasture does good things for your passwords:

- Pen them up in their very own pasture to keep them from wandering into naughty hands.
- Pasturize them, and remove all that icky stuff that you use to remember them.
- Start the process of putting them out to pasture, and dropping them altogether in exchange for something better.


### Pasture!

Pasture doesn't do much yet, but soon it will be a Chrome extension that does good things for your passwords.

For now, you can get it by checking out this repository and loading it as an unpacked extension in Chrome. One day it will be on the Chrome Web Store.

In the future there will be mobile apps and probably other implementation for other browsers. Maybe even IE.
